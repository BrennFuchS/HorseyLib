# Interactable
### A class to make interaction easier

<br>
Add component to gameobject for code to be ran
<i>All methods are only called at a max distance of 1 meter away just like the game does</i>

mouseExit | Called when the player's cursor is exits object
scrollUp | Called when the player scrolls up and moused over
scrollDown | Called when the player scrolls down and moused over
use | Called when the player presses the use key and moused over
lClick | Called when the player presses the left mouse button moused over
lHold | Called when the player holds the left mouse button moused over
lRelease | Called when the player releases the left mouse button or mouses off
rClick | Called when the player presses the right mouse button moused over
rHold | Called when the player holds the right mouse button moused over
rRelease | Called when the player releases the right mouse button or mouses off

<br>

## Example

```cs
class InteractableExample : Interactable
{
	public override void mouseEnter() => HorseyLib.GUIuse.value = true;

load\<T> | T | `string saveFile, T ifFail` | Load and return data from the save file

<br>

## Example

```cs
SaveBytes.save(saveFile,
	myColor,
	myQuaternion,
	myVector2,
	myVector3,
	myVector4
);

var data = SaveBytes.load(saveFile);
if (data == null) return; // failed to load save

myColor = (Color)data[0];
myQuaternion = (Quaternion)data[1];
myVector2 = (Vector2)data[2];
myVector3 = (Vector3)data[3];
myVector4 = (Vector4)data[4];
```
